//subsequence : A subsequence of a string is a sequence that can be derived from the given string by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements
//subsequence can be found out by 2powern - 1
//without changing the order means  RELATIVE ORDERING

//approach 1 :
//by using the two for loops by iterating the each substring we can check the longest common subsequence , time complexity will be O(n*n)

// approach 2 :
//by recursion  we will compare each sustring ,if it will be equal return 1 + recurison(*****)
//        else  we have two cases we can extend i and j and the max of that can be return   time complexity  O(2powern)
