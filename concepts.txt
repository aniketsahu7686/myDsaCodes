---------------------------What is Comparator in Arrays.sort()?---------------------------------------------

The Comparator is an interface used to define custom sorting logic when you're sorting an array of objects (like Task[], Student[], etc.).
( An array of objects in Java is just like an array of integers or strings — but instead of storing primitive types, it stores references to instances of a class (i.e., objects). )

class Task {
    int start;
    int end;

    Task(int start, int end) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }
}

Task[] tasks = {
    new Task(5, 10),
    new Task(1, 3),
    new Task(2, 8)
};


When you call:
Arrays.sort(array, comparator);
Java uses the provided comparator to determine how the elements should be ordered.



**Sorting by start in Ascending Order:
Arrays.sort(tasks, Comparator.comparingInt(task -> task.start));

🔍 What Happens Here?
comparingInt(task -> task.start) tells Java:
"Compare objects by their start field in ascending order."

So after sorting:
tasks = [
  Task(1, 3),
  Task(2, 8),
  Task(5, 10)
];



**Sorting by start in Descending Order:
Arrays.sort(tasks, Comparator.comparingInt(task -> task.start).reversed());

🔍 What Happens Here?
.reversed() tells Java:

"Reverse the order of comparison — so sort in descending order by start."
So after sorting:
tasks = [
  Task(5, 10),
  Task(2, 8),
  Task(1, 3)
];



**Arrays.sort(tasks, Comparator
    .comparingInt((Task task) -> task.start)
    .thenComparingInt(task -> task.end)
);
This will:
Sort tasks by their start time in ascending order.
If two tasks have the same start time, it will then sort them by end time in ascending order.
